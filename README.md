## Hi there üëã

![BANNER](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb4b16c9-6a21-4256-abd6-509397f03f8f)

My name is Skyler. I am an Information Technology student and Digital Media & Web Technologies graduate. 
I live at the intersection of development, design, and data. 

### I am currently working on:

     üçÉ "NativeBloom" (Next.js, React, Tailwind, ShadCN UI, Typescript, Firebase): Discover native plants specific to your geographical region (via zip code) and learn about invasive species to avoid.
        Allow NativeBloom to empower you to make environmentally conscious landscaping choices that support local ecosystems, conserve water, and promote biodiversity.
        Contributions welcome.

    üö® "Pervasion" Gun Violence Incident Counter (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript ES6+): A data dashboard-style web page simulating U.S. gun incident statistics using known national averages. 
        Accessible and dynamically animated. Planned upgrades include integrating Chart.js, Node.js/Express, and live CSV/API feeds.
        Contributions welcome.

    üï• "Twenty4" Sobriety Journal (React, Bootstrap, Laravel, Firebase): A nascent project restoring voices to people in alcoholism and addiction recovery. 
        Journal candidly with public/private diary toggle. Build community, chat with other users, find a sponsor, and locate resources to take charge of your sobriety. 
        Visualize your sobriety timeline with recovery milestones and profile badges. Log relapses. Lean on your village.
        Contributions welcome.

### First and foremost...

‚≠ê‚≠ê I envision myself contributing to teams that push boundaries, challenge the status quo, and confront pressing issues in bold, unprecedented ways. 

‚≠ê‚≠ê I‚Äôm confident in my ability to integrate my professional skills across a range of disciplines, including full stack development, information architecture, news and television, social media, and multi-platform media like web, radio, print, illustration, design, marketing, and advertising.

### üëÄ In my free time:
 I never stop reading. James Baldwin is my favorite author. I listen to every genre of music under the sun; I've played alto and tenor saxophone since I was seven years old. I even played in a jazz band! üé∑
        I'm an award-nominated gun violence prevention activist who has worked with families from Parkland, Uvalde, Sandy Hook, Columbine, and many more. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
        I'm a big fan of art that pisses people off. I seek out people who, like me, forge trends, not merely react to them. üî•

### üåÜ Cool people I've met through my work:
Shepard Fairey, Julianne Moore, Laura Dern, and my idols in art, activism, and advertising: Manuel and Patricia Oliver.
